## R.I.P. Fender FUSE

Unfortunately, *Fender* FUSE reached End of Life this march and there is no way to download any of the community presets anymore. 

Luckily, [a user on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/fxxg4w/question_what_is_the_alternative_to_fender_fuse/) has made a backup in 2017 of **9764** presets! ðŸ˜®ðŸ˜‡ 

I want to provide a file backup, in case the location will be invalid in the future.

Keep rocking! ðŸ¤˜
