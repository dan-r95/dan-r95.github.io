Hey there, maybe some of these programs are useful to you :) I added some links as well

* Win Merge (compare two files for differences)
* Inkscape (SVG, PDF edit and crop)
* PostMan (REST Api requests and test)
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (convert video)
* [cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) (alternative to windows command line)
* Chocolatey, a package manager for windows
